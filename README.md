# MufflerCore
The core functionality for truly muffling or suppressing sentences provided by text, and converting them into 
a muffled or garbled form based on the kind of object being used to suppress the sound.


### NOTICE:
This conversion into a submodule from the original baseline code is still a WIP and may not properly work as you expect.
